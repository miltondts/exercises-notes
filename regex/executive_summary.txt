Regular Expressions
- Used for text processing, namely for search and/or replace operations.
- Used to match patterns. Most implementation return only the first match
but some return a list of matches.
- Developed as a mathematical concept, it started to be used in UNIX and
is now common to every programming language.

Used on sed and grep tools.
GREP -> Global Regular Expression Print

Special characters:
. -> period -> every character, alphabetic character, digit or period.
\ -> backlsash -> used to escape metacharacters (i.e. turns special 
characters into regular characters)
[ ] -> open and close brackets -> define a set of characters
[ - ] -> hifen -> when used inside a set it defines a range, else it
is a regular character 
[ ^ ] -> caret -> negates a set (i.e. All but ...) 
(e.g [^0-9] -> all non-digits)
\n -> new line
[\b] -> backspace
\t -> tab
\r -> return
+ -> plus sign -> one or more characters (functionaly equivalent to {1,})
* -> asterisk ->  zero or more characters (equivalent to {0,})
? -> question mark -> zero or one characters (equivalent to {0, 1})
{ } -> open a close curly braces -> intervals/number of matches 
	e.g
	{3} -> match 3 characters
	{2, 4} -> match a minimum of 2 and maximum of 4 characters 
 	{2,} -> match at least 2 characters
\b \b-> word boundaries
^ $ -> string boundaries (just like VIM beggining and end of line)

Class metacharacters:
\d -> digit (same as [0-9]) 
\w -> Lower and upper case letter, digit or underscore (alphanumeric)
\s -> whitespace character (except backspace)
\D -> non-digit
\W -> non-alphanumeric 
\S -> non-whitespace


Greedy and lazy quantifiers:
* and + are greedy and match the most characters they can  <- AVOID THIS
but *? and +? are lazy and only match the characters they have to

Notes:
- sets of all letters must be state as [A-Za-z] because the [A-z] matches
all ASCII characters between Z and a (e.g. [ or ^)
- fun-fact: \n is a special character because it is escaped and a regular 
character when not. Usually it's the other way around.
