HARDWARE:
The hardware requirements for this case are a monitor (the monitor’s size will limit the maximum size of the canvas) and a keyboard should possess the “up”, “down”, “w” and “s” keys.
If the computer used for development supports drRacket then in must also support the implicit CPU and graphics board requirements.

SOFTWARE:
BSL’s “2htdp/image” library can support the creation of the field, players, ball, net and score. The field will be an empty-scene, the players’ rectangles, the ball a square, the net will be a line with a pen structure and the score will be text.

The “2htdp/universe” library will be used to deal with events:
on-tick will be used to update the ball’s position with the progression of time.
on-key will be used to update the player cursors when a key is pressed.
to-draw will be used to render each actor’s current state.
