Assuming consistency as guaranteeing the same output for a given input

5.1
f(x) = 1 is consistent, but will return the same input for all values

5.2
f(x) = rand() is not consistent

5.3
f(x) = next_empty_slot() is not consistent

5.4
f(x) = len(x) is consistent, but will return the same output for a lot of values

5.5
(k, v) = (name, phone_number) = (variable length string, 9 digit integer)
A would not do because it always returns 1.
B would not do because 3 of the items have the same length, this would lead to
collisions.
C would not do because several items start with the same letter.
For D:
	Esther => (11 + 37 + 39 + 17 + 11 + 35) % 10 = 150 % 10 = 0
	Ben => (3 + 11 + 29) % 10 = 43 % 10 = 3
	Bob => (3 + 31 + 3) % 10 = 37 % 10 = 7
	Dan => (7 + 2 + 29) % 10 = 38 % 10 = 8

No collisions in this case. The load factor is 4 / 10 = 0.4

5.6
A mapping from battery size to power can be obtained from example B or even
by D

5.7 
Here we can use C and D and, if we consider the space when calculating the
length of the string, we can even use B
