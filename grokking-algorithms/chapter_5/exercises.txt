Assuming consistency as guaranteeing the same output for a given input

5.1
f(x) = 1 is consistent, but will return the same input for all values

5.2
f(x) = rand() is not consistent

5.3
f(x) = next_empty_slot() is not consistent

5.4
f(x) = len(x) is consistent, but will return the same output for a lot of values
