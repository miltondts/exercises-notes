Exercise 3.1

From the image, one can know that the first function called was greet(), with the
input string "maggie", and is the lower part of the stack, and we are currently 
running the greet2() function with the same input. 
Once greet2() returns, we'll go back to greet(), and greet2() gets popped off.


Exercise 3.2

If my recursive function runs forever it's just going to keep taking more
and more memory. The computer is going to save information for all the function
calls.
That's why some programming language (like Python) throw an error for maximum 
recursion depth.
