2.1
We should use lists given they take O(n) time for reading but take O(1) time for inserting and most of the operations that we’ll be performing are insertions.

2.2
Lets go with lists. Because we’re constantly going to be inserting data into and deleting it from the queue, and lists are better at these operations.

2.3
Given it needs random access, information should be stored in an array.

2.4
The downside is that arrays take O(n) (linear time) for inserts and deletions. These operations are slow.
Every time you add user to the array you need either to shift a bunch of other elements to other indexes or create a new, larger, copy of the array to store all the users + the new one
